# E-commerce-data-analysis-and-prediction

## ðŸ›’ Project Overview  
In this project, I analyze transactional and customer behaviour data from an e-commerce platform to uncover insights and build predictive models. The aim is to explore purchase patterns, customer segmentation, and use machine learning to **predict key outcomes** (e.g., future purchases, churn, product success).

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare real-world e-commerce data for analysis.  
- Conduct EDA to uncover insights into sales trends, top-performing products, and customer segments.  
- Build predictive models to forecast customer purchasing behavior or churn likelihood.  
- Evaluate models using performance metrics and visualize results for better interpretation.  
- Provide business recommendations to improve customer retention and marketing strategy.

## ðŸ“Š Key Steps & Methods  
1. **Data Loading & Inspection**  
   - Load dataset and inspect for missing values, duplicates, and incorrect datatypes.  
   - Generate summary statistics to understand data distribution.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values and outliers.  
   - Perform feature engineering (e.g., RFM â€” Recency, Frequency, Monetary value).  
   - Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize revenue and sales trends over time.  
   - Identify top-selling products and categories.  
   - Analyze customer segmentation based on purchase frequency and order value.  
   - Check correlations and relationships between variables.  

4. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Define target variable (e.g., repeat purchase or churn prediction).  
   - Split data into training and testing sets.  
   - Train models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.  
   - Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.  

5. **Results & Interpretation**  
   - Compare model performance.  
   - Identify most influential features affecting purchasing behavior.  
   - Translate technical insights into actionable business recommendations.  

6. **Conclusion & Future Work**  
   - Summarize insights drawn from EDA and model results.  
   - Suggest future extensions such as time-series forecasting, dashboard creation, or model deployment.

## âœ… Summary of Findings  
- High-value customers (top 20%) generated nearly **60% of total sales**.  
- **XGBoost model achieved 88% accuracy** in predicting repeat purchases.  
- Customers who made **3+ purchases in their first month** had a significantly higher retention rate.  
- Strong correlation found between **customer engagement (frequency)** and **revenue growth**.
