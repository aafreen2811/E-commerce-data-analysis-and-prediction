# E-commerce-data-analysis-and-prediction

## ðŸ›’ Project Overview  
In this project, I analyze transactional and customer behaviour data from an e-commerce platform to uncover insights and build predictive models. The aim is to explore purchase patterns, customer segmentation, and use machine learning to **predict key outcomes** (e.g., future purchases, churn, product success).

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand user behaviour, sales trends, product performance.  
- Clean and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, outliers, feature engineering).  
- Visualise major patterns: top-selling items, seasonal trends, customer segments.  
- Build predictive models (classification/regression depending on target) to forecast outcomes such as repeat purchase, customer churn or product demand.  
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics and interpret the results.


## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** â€“ Main language used  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** â€“ Data manipulation & numeric operations  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly** â€“ Data visualisation  
- **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost** (or similar) â€“ Machine learning modelling  
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Interactive environment for analysis  

## ðŸ“Š Key Steps & Methods  
1. **Data Loading & Inspection**: Load the dataset, check for missing values, duplicates, data types, basic descriptive stats.  
2. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Clean data: handle missing values, outliers  
   - Feature engineering: e.g., customer lifetime value, recency/frequency/monetary (RFM) features  
   - Encoding categorical variables, scaling numeric features  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Visualise revenue trends over time  
   - Top products/categories by sales  
   - Customer segmentation by purchase frequency, average order value  
   - Correlation analysis and basic statistics  
4. **Predictive Modelling**:  
   - Define target variable (e.g., repeat purchase yes/no, churn, next-month spending)  
   - Split data into train/test sets  
   - Train models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation  
   - Evaluate using metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification; RMSE/MAPE for regression)  
5. **Results & Interpretation**:  
   - Compare model performances  
   - Interpret feature importances  
   - Provide business-relevant insights (e.g., which features drive repeat purchases)  
6. **Conclusion & Future Work**:  
   - Summarise key findings  
   - Suggest how this could be extended (e.g., deploy as dashboard, use time-series forecasting, add external data)
