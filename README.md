# E-commerce-data-analysis-and-prediction

## ðŸ›’ Project Overview  
In this project, I analyze transactional and customer behaviour data from an e-commerce platform to uncover insights and build predictive models. The aim is to explore purchase patterns, customer segmentation, and use machine learning to **predict key outcomes** (e.g., future purchases, churn, product success).

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand user behaviour, sales trends, product performance.  
- Clean and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, outliers, feature engineering).  
- Visualise major patterns: top-selling items, seasonal trends, customer segments.  
- Build predictive models (classification/regression depending on target) to forecast outcomes such as repeat purchase, customer churn or product demand.  
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics and interpret the results.
