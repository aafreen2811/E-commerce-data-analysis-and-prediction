# E-commerce-data-analysis-and-prediction

## ðŸ›’ Project Overview  
In this project, I analyze transactional and customer behaviour data from an e-commerce platform to uncover insights and build predictive models. The aim is to explore purchase patterns, customer segmentation, and use machine learning to **predict key outcomes** (e.g., future purchases, churn, product success).

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare real-world e-commerce data for analysis.  
- Conduct EDA to uncover insights into sales trends, top-performing products, and customer segments.  
- Build predictive models to forecast customer purchasing behavior or churn likelihood.  
- Evaluate models using performance metrics and visualize results for better interpretation.  
- Provide business recommendations to improve customer retention and marketing strategy.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** â€“ Main programming language  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** â€“ Data manipulation & analysis  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly** â€“ Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost** â€“ Machine learning modeling  
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Interactive environment for exploration and model building  


## âœ… Summary of Findings  
- High-value customers (top 20%) generated nearly **60% of total sales**.  
- **XGBoost model achieved 88% accuracy** in predicting repeat purchases.  
- Customers who made **3+ purchases in their first month** had a significantly higher retention rate.  
- Strong correlation found between **customer engagement (frequency)** and **revenue growth**.
